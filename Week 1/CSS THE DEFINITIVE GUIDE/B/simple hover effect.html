        Most books we read in Western languages format paragraphs of text with the first line
indented, and no blank line between paragraphs. Some sites used to create the illu‐
sion of indented text by placing a small transparent image before the first letter in a
paragraph, which shoved the text over. <span> Thanks to CSS, there’s a much better way to
indent text: text-indent. </span>
